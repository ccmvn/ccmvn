  <h1>Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ¦Š</h1>

As a passionate software developer I'm primarily focused on backend development using C++ and Rust. However, I also have experience in Python and Java/Kotlin. I enjoy creating innovative solutions and writing high-quality code that is scalable, robust, and maintainable. I also hold an [EXIN Scrum Master certification](https://mylogin.exin.nl/AppPool_4/polarserver.asp?ToolName=CertificateCheckTool&LastName=Juraschka&CertificateNumber=6509563.20853875&ModuleID=630589&SID=67CE8A028C7AD649BC7C153D0B58C185&PageID=0) that validates my knowledge and skills in leading and facilitating agile development teams.

Throughout my professional journey, I've gained valuable experience working with various technologies and tools. From working with Protocol Buffers and gRPC to designing appealing user interfaces using Bootstrap 5, I've continuously expanded my knowledge and embraced new challenges. I also have experience with relational database models, specifically MySQL and MariaDB.

On this GitHub profile, you'll find a collection of projects I've worked on. I'm always eager to share my insights and solutions with fellow developers and appreciate any feedback or collaboration opportunities.

If you have any questions, want to exchange ideas, or are interested in contributing to any of my projects, feel free to reach out. I'm open to new possibilities and enjoy engaging with like-minded individuals.

Thank you for visiting, I hope you enjoy exploring my projects! ðŸ¦Š
